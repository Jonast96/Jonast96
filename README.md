As a student of front-end development, I am highly motivated and eager to continue learning and improving my skills. I am scheduled to graduate in the summer of 2023, and am confident that my passion for computers and technology will lead me to a successful career in the field. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors through activities such as hiking and fishing, and also enjoy spending time with friends. However, I often find myself drawn back to my true passion of coding and playing games.
