I'm currently studying front-end development and will be done in the summer of 2023. I've always been really interested in computers and how stuff works, so i'm really enjoying my time studying web development and creating different websites. Outside of my studies try to get out and go hiking, fishing or hang out with friends, but i often end up coding or playing games.
